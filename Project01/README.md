# Project 01: GET TO KNOW YOUR TOOLS

## About
In this chapter, I was introduced to the concept of voltage, currents, and resistors along with electrical components such as transducers, sensors, actuators, and circuts. 

I learned how to read the color codes on the resistors and how the breadboard can be used to create circuits
